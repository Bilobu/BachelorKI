Hello OSRAM Team!,  Due Date September/12/2016

As part of HP's engagement with the ODMs, the ODMs provide various circuit solutions (building blocks) to HP for consideration as part of program feasibility.

The architectural hardware team and marketing team review those proposals, and they solicit support from our team to provide component pricing to roll-up the total solution costs.  Then the various circuit solutions are benchmarked on features and cost.
Since this activity is within the concept/feasibility phase, we view this as a high-level activity and preliminary to any design-in or negotiations we may do after a program has solidified.  Your participation is vital and valuable toward HP's determination of future products and features.
Your timely response and information is much appreciated!

Can you help us with a quote for these parts?

Description     Manufacturer ID Manufacturer PN
DIODE, SMT, HIGH PWR, IR OSLUX, INFRARED EMITTER, 810nm, 2-PAD  OSRAM   SFH 4780S


If you already have a price established for, or agreed with a particular HP Business Group, please provide such price (A recent quote, A rebate price etc).
Our team may not know of such interactions or price agreements.

Related information:
Platform: Phablet application, but no CM-ODM is defined/awarded at this point.
